    <p>This App allows the user to build a phylogenetic tree of related genomes that are strain variants.</p>

    <p>Strain-level similar genomes cannot be aligned using protein sequences.  This App allows for alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction by performing a nucleotide multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the largest genome segment of a collection of genomes.  It includes the same parameters as would be given to each of the steps separately, starting with <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_muscle/MUSCLE_nuc_genome">MUSCLE</a> to build the initial Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), then <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_gblocks/run_Gblocks">Gblocks</a> to trim the MSA to the less variable regions, and finally <a href="https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_fasttree/run_FastTree">FastTree-2</a> to build the phylogenetic inference from the distances between the nucleotide sequences in the MSA.</p>

    <p>There is an option to skip trimming that is the recommended mode when genomes are very similar and indels are likely to yield meaningful phylogenetic signal.</p>
    
    <p>This method is meant to be used on small genomes, such as viruses and, while it may function, is not optimized for even small bacteria.</a>

    <p><hr></p>
    <p><b>MUSCLE</b> performs a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of homologously related sequences.</p>

    <p><b>Gblocks</b> trims Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) to capture the conserved blocks that may be more reliable regions from which to compare evolutionary rates, such as for tree building.  Gblocks 0.91b from http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks.html</p>

    <p><b>FastTree-2</b> builds a Phylogenetic Tree reconstruction from a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of protein sequences.  Tree display uses ETE3 (v3.0.0b35).  FastTree2.1.9 from <a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/</a></p>
