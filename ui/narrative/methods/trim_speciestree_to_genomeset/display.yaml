    <p>This App allows the user to trim a Species Tree to just include the Genomes that are found in a GenomeSet.  The trimmed tree is then offered as a static image and provided as links to download the image in PNG and PDF formats.  One can also download a file containing the NEWICK representation of the tree (with identifiers or labels). There is also button (‘View report in separate window’) and a link to open a new web page with just the image of the tree.</p>
