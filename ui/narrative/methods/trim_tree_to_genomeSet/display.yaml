    <p><i>Trim Species Tree to GenomeSet</i> App written by Dylan Chivian (DCChivian@lbl.gov)</p>
    <p>App will collapse a Species Tree object to only contain leaves correspondng to members of a GenomeSet.  Any extra genomes in the GenomeSet that are not found in the tree will be ignored.  Essentially this App represents an intersection of the SpeciesTree and the GenomeSet.</p>
