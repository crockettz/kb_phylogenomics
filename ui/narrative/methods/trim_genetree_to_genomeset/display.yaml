        ui-name : |
            Tree
        short-hint : |
            The GeneTree object to trim.
    input_genomeSet_ref :
        ui-name : |
            GenomeSet
        short-hint : |
            The GenomeSet to trim the tree to match.

        ui-name : |
            Description
        short-hint : |
            A description of the SpeciesTree which will be added to the title in the tree image.
    output_tree_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output Tree
        short-hint : |
            The name of the output Tree object
    enforce_genome_version_match :
        ui-name : |
            Enforce genome version match
        short-hint : |
            Require that the genome version between the GenomeSet and the SpeciesTree be the same to retain in output SpeciesTree
    keep_ama_genes :
        ui-name : |
            Keep AMA genes
        short-hint : |
            Annotated Metagenome Assemblies aren't in GenomeSets, so keep their genes in GeneTree.

description : |
    <p>This App allows the user to trim a Gene Tree object to just include genes from Genomes that are found in a GenomeSet.  The trimmed tree is saved as a new Gene Tree object and is offered as a static image and provided as links to download the image in PNG and PDF formats.  One can also download a file containing the NEWICK representation of the tree (with identifiers or labels). There is also button (‘View report in separate window’) and a link to open a new web page with just the image of the tree.</p>
