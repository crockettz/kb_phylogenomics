        ui-name : |
            Empty categories
        short-hint : |

    <p>This App constructs a heatmap or numeric table showing protein domains that are present in the genomes of all the organisms contained in a phylogenetic species tree. It is recommended to use genomes annotated with RAST if you want to analyze SEED roles, but genomes annotated with Prokka or other tools are fine for other domain namespaces.</p>

    <p>To use this App, you must first construct a tree with your genomes using either the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/SpeciesTreeBuilder/insert_set_of_genomes_into_species_tree/release”>Insert Genome Into Species Tree</a> or the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/SpeciesTreeBuilder/insert_genomeset_into_species_tree/release”>Insert Set of Genomes Into Species Tree</a> Apps. It is recommended that you set those tree building apps to “Copy public genomes to your workspace” and use the genome set created by these Apps to facilitate success in the next steps to use this viewer. Next, you must perform domain annotation on all of the genomes in your tree, by using the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/kb_phylogenomics/run_DomainAnnotation_Sets/release”>Annotate Domains in a GenomeSet</a> App on the genome set associated with your species tree.</p>

    <p>If there are any genomes present in the tree that are not annotated with domains, the app will fail. The error message “MISSING DOMAIN ANNOTATION FOR: 43454/34/1” indicates which genome in the Data Panel needs domain annotation. Check that all of the genomes in the tree have corresponding Genome and Domain Annotation objects in your Data Panel. Run the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#appcatalog/app/DomainAnnotation/annotate_domains_in_a_genome/release”>Annotate Domains in a Genome</a> App on any genomes that lack a corresponding Domain Annotation object. These steps are required to ensure this viewer will function properly. Additionally, the Domain Annotation objects are linked to the version of the Genome object that was annotated, but it may be that the version of the Genome object has incremented, so the default behavior is to use the newest version of the Genome found in the workspace.</p>

    <p>You can use this App to examine the general domain distribution or specific functional gene families for all the genomes in the species tree, sorted according to their position in the tree. Choose a Domain Namespace to view hits for all protein domain terms from COG Functional Categories, Pfam A Clans, TIGRfam Roles, and SEED Roles. Enable and set the Custom Domains parameters to limit the report to a subselection of terms. The output report can be a heatmap to visualize the degree of hits for genes that correspond to motifs associated with protein domains, or a numeric table containing the count of hits. The output report also provides a key for the functional domain terms from each of these databases; terms not associated with any hits will appear with grey background color.</p>
